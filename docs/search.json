    "text": "Let’s suppose we are interested in the relationship between disturbance (D) and vegetation diversity (V). We assert that disturbance has a causal effect on diversity such that \\(D \\rightarrow V\\).\nBoth disturbance and vegetation diversity arise from spatial processes, and the data we use to study them are collected in space. This makes it natural to assume that there may be some spatial autocorrelation in these measures. We might think it is simply a question of how to control for this autocorrelation so that we can get a precise estimate of the effect of D on V. For example, we might use a conditional autoregressive model, treating D and V as emissions from a random field.\nHowever, I argue that rather than assuming we must control for autocorrelation, we need o first determine whether we need to adjust for autocorrelation by looking at the problem from a causal inference perspective.\n\nA Joint Spatial Process\nFor example, let’s suppose that D and V arise jointly from a spatial process S.\n\nlibrary(dagitty)\nlibrary(ggdag)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndag2 = dagify(\n  V ~ D, \n  D ~ S, \n  V ~ S,\n  exposure = 'D', \n  outcome  = 'V'\n)\nggdag(dag2, layout = 'circle') + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis DAG says that both of our measures, D and V, are caused by the same spatial process. Put differently, the effect of D on V is confounded by spatial autocorrelation in these variables. This implies that we must include S in a model.\n\nggdag_adjustment_set(dag2) + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple enough. But is this actually plausible? If true, then disturbance and vegetation diversity must both occur at a similar scale. This is a strong assumption considering that measures of vegetation diversity occur at the organism or stand level, whereas disturbance is typically a patch level phenomenon. If there is spatial structure to these measures, they would occur at distinct scales.\nMoreover, the processes that underlie this spatial structure are probably distinct. Disturbances, for example, can be due to tree-falls, hurricanes, landslides, anthropogenic land changes, diseases or pest outbreaks, and so on. These are quite different from the processes that shape vegetation diversity like local competition, facilitation, and mutualism; dispersal and recruitment; or nutrient availability.\n\n\nIndependent Spatial Processes\nIt seems more likely that D and V have their own spatial patterns arises from distinct processes. This implies a DAG like this:\n\ndag3 = dagify(\n  V ~ D, \n  D ~ S_D, \n  V ~ S_V,\n  exposure = 'D', \n  outcome  = 'V'\n)\nggdag(dag3, layout = 'tree') + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is our generating process, then we need to be much more careful about including S_D and S_V in a model.\n\nggdag_adjustment_set(dag3) + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current structure contains no backdoor paths. If we include S_D, for example, then we will filter our any effect of D that is correlated with S_D. One could then ask: “Why not condition directly on S_D and leave our D, altogether?” This could work but only if we know that the variation in S_D is due solely to the disturbance. S_V does not have these same issues We could include S_V as a covariate that might improve the precision of our estimate of D on V.\n\n\nPrimary and Secondary Structure\nNow here is where this gets interesting. S_D and S_V are what some might call “secondary spatial structure”. They are patterns of vegetation and disturbance that are overlaid on the landscape with all its topography and geomorphology – the primary spatial structure. One could very reasonably assume that this primary structure influences the secondary structure. Indeed, many have debated this tension in the literature. A DAG representing this might look like the following:\n\ndag4 = dagify(\n  V ~ D, \n  D ~ S_D, \n  V ~ S_V,\n  S_D ~ P, \n  S_V ~ P,\n  exposure = 'D', \n  outcome  = 'V'\n)\nggdag(dag4, layout = 'tree') + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we again have a backdoor between D and V through the influence of P on S_D and S_V. This means that in order to estimate the relationship between D and V, we must adust for P, assuming that we have a measure of it.\n\nggdag_adjustment_set(dag4) + theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, one can break the backdoor path by adjusting for any of the parents of D and V. However, we must be careful here about what we actually mean by P. For all we know, P could represent physical laws. If that is the case, then pretty much any DAG we ever draw would be confounded! What began as a relatively simple modeling problem has taken us to a deeply philosophical place where we question whether we can ever really know the causal effect of anything…\nOkay, that was a little unserious. Of course we can know causal effects. And P in the graph cannot be the fundamental laws of physics. Even if they were, they would be constants and so they would do little to shape any variation in these variables.\nThe more prudent question is whether there is an ultimate common cause of spatial structure."

    "text": "Food webs are often represented as network graphs, where nodes represent species and links represent observed feeding interactions, or potential feeding interactions inferred from species traits. The Web of Life database houses many such graphs, showcasing their interesting structural patterns and the tremendous efforts ecologists have gone to in order to collect these challenging data.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example food web originally published by Bascompte, Melián, and Sala (2005).\n\n\n\n\nA particular challenge when collecting food web data is knowing whether sampling effort is sufficient. Consider the implications of missing some feeding links. If an interaction involving even a single rare species goes unobserved, it can impact the overall network structure. Since many theories of food webs focus directly on explaining the structure of food webs, measurement models are needed that can help us infer whether the observed structure results from fundamental processes of community assembly or from partial sampling. In this blog post, we explore this measurement problem and develop some preliminary simulations and validations.\nTo begin, let’s lay out a basic model. Let’s assume that we want to infer species interactions using a hierarchical model (multiple food webs). This let’s us pool information from across multiple webs to understand our ability to detect trophic links.\nFor each food web \\(k = 1,...,K\\), we observe pairs of species interactions \\(A^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). A value of \\(1\\) indicates the presence of a link between \\(i \\rightarrow j\\). Given this, we model the probability of a link \\(p_{ij,k}\\) as\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{logit}(p_{ij,k}) = \\alpha_k + u_{i,k} + v_{j,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_k\\) is a baseline interaction rate for web \\(k\\), and \\(u_{i,k}\\) and \\(v_{j,k}\\) are consumer- and resource-specific random effects. We could then say that the “true” set of interactions is Bernoulli distributed\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nA^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{ij,k})\n\\end{equation}\n\\] In other words, there is a probability \\(p_{ij,k}\\) that we observe a link between \\(ij\\) in food web \\(k\\). Such a probability could be directly computed from \\(A\\). But if sampling is biased, then this probability will inherit this bias. For this reason, we also need a detection model.\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_k) = \\mu_p + \\delta_{p,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWe assume that each web has its own rate of detection \\(\\pi_k\\). The parameter \\(\\mu_k\\) is the average log-odds of detection across all food webs, and \\(\\delta_{p,k}\\) is a specific deviation of web \\(k\\) from the global average, which we model as non-centered: \\(\\delta_{\\pi,k} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\pi})\\).\nIt follows that the probability of observing a link is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nq_{ij,k} = \\pi_k \\cdot p_{ij,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\] We use this to amend our original likelihood to\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nA^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(q_{ij,k})\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nIn essence, this model assumes that\n\nIf \\(A^{\\text{true}}_{ij,k} = 0\\), then \\(A^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} = 0\\).\nIf \\(A^{\\text{true}}_{ij,k} = 1\\), then we observe \\(A^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} = 1\\) with probability \\(\\pi_{ij,k}\\).\n\nAlthough false positives are also a possible source of bias, we leave this out of the model, for now.\nFinally, we need to declare hierarchical, non-centered priors for all parameters, beginning first with the interaction rates, then the detection probabilities, and finally the random effects. We assume a weakly informative \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) prior on all latent deviations, and \\(\\text{Exponential}(1)\\) for all SD."

    "text": "In the previous post, we discussed how the probability of a feeding link between two species depends in part on the probability of detecting the link during the sampling effort. Accounting for this is an important step toward understanding whether the food web structure we are studying is due to ecological processes that underlie community assembly, or some sampling bias (or both).\nAs a reminder, our existing model treats the probability of an observed link in a web (\\(A_{ij,k}\\)) as\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA_{ij,k} &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(q_{ij,k}) \\\\\nq_{ij,k} &= p_k \\pi_{ij,k} \\\\\np_k &= \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mu_{p} + \\delta_{p,k}) \\\\\n\\pi_{ij,k} &= \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\alpha_k + u_{i,k} + v_{j,k}) \\\\\n\\alpha_k &= \\mu_{\\alpha} + \\sigma_{\\alpha} \\alpha^{(z)}_k \\\\\nu_{i,k} &= \\sigma_u u^{(z)}_{i,k} \\\\\nv_{j,k} &= \\sigma_v v^{(z)}_{j,k} \\\\\np^{(z)}_k, \\alpha^{(z)}_k, u^{(z)}_{i,k},v^{(z)}_{j,k} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\pi_{ij,k}\\)\ntrue ecological interaction probability\n\n\n\\(p_k\\)\ndetection probability for web \\(k\\)\n\n\n\\(q_{ij,k}\\)\nprobability of observing interaction\n\n\n\\(\\alpha_k\\)\nbaseline interaction rate in web \\(k\\)\n\n\n\\(u_{i,k}\\)\nconsumer \\(i\\) feeding generality\n\n\n\\(v_{j,k}\\)\nresource \\(j\\) feeding vulnerability\n\n\n\\(\\mu_p\\)\noverall mean detection\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_p\\)\nbetween-web variation in detection\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{\\alpha}\\)\noverall mean interaction rate\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_{\\alpha}\\)\nbetween-web variation in interaction rate\n\n\n\\(*^{(z)}\\)\nstandardized, non-centered latent deviations\n\n\n\nThough this is an important advance, our detection probability is just another probability that we estimate. It is treated as a latent, random effect that accounts for false negatives. However, it might be reasonable to assume that detection is non-random: species with particular traits may be more readily observed. For example, if larger species are easier to sample, then we would detect their diets more often. To incorporate this, we make an adjustment to Equation 3. We have a few options here. First, let \\(M_i\\) and \\(M_j\\) be the log body masses of consumer \\(i\\) and resource \\(j\\).\n\n\n\nWe define a parameter \\(\\beta_M\\) which controls the effect of consumer body mass on detection.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{logit}(p_{i,k}) = \\mu_p + \\beta_M M_i + \\sigma_p p^{(z)}_{i,k}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\beta_M &gt; 0\\), the feeding links of larger species are detected more often.\n\n\n\nAn second approach could hypothesize that it is the ratio of \\(M_i\\) to \\(M_j\\) that influences detection. Since both covariates are on a log scale, we compute the difference between them and estimate the effect \\(\\beta_R\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{logit}(p_{ij,k}) &= \\mu_p + \\beta_R (M_i - M_j) + \\sigma_p p^{(z)}_{ij,k}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nA third option would be to focus on the absolute difference between the species body sizes. This means something quite difference biologically.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{logit}(p_{ij,k}) &= \\mu_p + \\beta_A |M_i - M_j| + \\sigma_p p^{(z)}_{ij,k}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEach of the detection mechanisms contain very different assumptions about how detection scales body size.\n\nConsumer Size Model: This individual-level mechanism suggests that probability scales with the body size of the consumer, regardless of the size of the prey. Large predators are easier to observe and thus their feeding links are easier to detect.\nSize Ratio Model: This edge-level mechanisms suggests that the probability of observing a feeding link depends on the ratio of consumer to resource body size. Observing large predators feeding on smaller prey are more likely, whereas a predator which is much smaller than it prey are ecological unusual and difficult to detect. The detection probability of such unusual events is proportionally lower.\nSize Mismatch Model: This edge-level mechanism assumes that detection probability depends on the absolute difference between predators and prey. This mechanism does not imply that size mismatches are uncommon, only that such interactions leave evidence that is more difficult to detect.\n\nTo further investigate these mechanisms, we can simulate their effect on detection probability.\n\n# Setup\nset.seed(666)\n\ninv_logit &lt;- function(x) exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))\n\n# Parameters\nN &lt;- 50\nmu_p &lt;- -2\nsigma_p &lt;- 0.25\nbM &lt;- bR &lt;- bA &lt;- 0.5\n\n# Body mass\nmass &lt;- exp(seq(log(0.01), log(1000), length.out = N))  # mass on raw scale\nM &lt;- log10(mass)  # log10 body mass\n\n# Pairwise matrices\nBi &lt;- matrix(M, N, N)  # consumer\nBj &lt;- t(Bi)            # resource\n\n# Covariates\nratio &lt;- Bi - Bj\nmismatch &lt;- abs(Bi - Bj)\n\n# Noise\neps &lt;- matrix(rnorm(N*N, 0, sigma_p), N, N)\n\n# (1) Consumer Size Model\npM &lt;- inv_logit(mu_p + bM * M + rnorm(N, 0, sigma_p))\npM_mat &lt;- matrix(pM, N, N, byrow = TRUE)\ndiag(pM_mat) &lt;- NA\n\n# (2) Size Ratio Model\npR_mat &lt;- inv_logit(mu_p + bR * ratio + eps)\ndiag(pR_mat) &lt;- NA\n\n# (3) Size Mismatch Model\npA_mat &lt;- inv_logit(mu_p + bA * mismatch + eps)\ndiag(pA_mat) &lt;- NA\n\n# (4) Random Model - uniform random probabilities\np_rand_mat &lt;- matrix(runif(N * N, min = 0, max = 1), N, N)\ndiag(p_rand_mat) &lt;- NA\n\n\n# Data for plotting\ndat &lt;- data.frame(\n  consumer_mass_log10 = as.vector(Bi),\n  resource_mass_log10 = as.vector(Bj),\n  size_ratio = as.vector(ratio),\n  size_mismatch = as.vector(mismatch),\n  p_consumer = as.vector(pM_mat),\n  p_ratio = as.vector(pR_mat),\n  p_mismatch = as.vector(pA_mat), \n  p_random = as.vector(p_rand_mat)\n)\n\nFirst, we can consider the matrices produced by these models.
