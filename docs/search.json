    "title": "Food Web Generation and Measurement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Food webs are often represented as network graphs, where nodes represent species and links represent observed feeding interactions, or potential feeding interaction inferred from species traits. The Web of Life database houses many such graphs, showcasing their interesting structural patterns and the tremendous efforts ecologists have gone to in order to collect these challenging data.\nA particular challenge when collecting food web data is knowing whether sampling effort is sufficient. This is particular relevant when studying networks because if even a single rare species goes unobserved, it can impact the overall network structure. Since many theories of food webs focus directly on explaining the structure of food webs, measurement models are needed that can help us infer whether the observed structure results from fundamental processes of community assembly or from partial sampling. In this blog post, we explore this measurement problem and develop some preliminary simulations and validations.\nTo begin, let’s lay out a basic model. Let’s assume that we want to infer species interactions using a hierarchical model (multiple food webs). This let’s us pool information from across multiple webs to understand our ability to detect trophic links.\nFor each food web \\(k = 1,...,K\\), we observe pairs of species interactions \\(A^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). A value of \\(1\\) indicates the presence of a link between \\(i \\rightarrow j\\). Given this, we model the probability of a link \\(p_{ij,k}\\) as\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{logit}(p_{ij,k}) = \\alpha_k + u_{i,k} + v_{j,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_k\\) is a baseline interaction rate for web \\(k\\), and \\(u_{i,k}\\) and \\(v_{j,k}\\) are consumer- and resource-specific random effects. We could then say that the “true” set of interactions is Bernoulli distributed\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nA^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{ij,k})\n\\end{equation}\n\\] In other words, there is a probability \\(p_{ij,k}\\) that we observe a link between \\(ij\\) in food web \\(k\\). Such a probability could be directly computed from \\(A\\). But if sampling is biased, then this probability will inherit this bias. For this reason, we also need a detection model.\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{logit}(\\phi_k) = \\mu_p + \\delta_{p,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWe assume that each web has its own detection probability \\(\\phi_k\\). The parameter \\(\\mu_k\\) is the average detection probability across all food webs, and \\(\\delta_{p,k}\\) is a specific deviation of web \\(k\\) from the global average, which we model as non-centered: \\(\\delta_{\\phi,k} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\phi})\\).\nIt follows that the probability of observing a link is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nq_{ij,k} = \\phi_k \\cdot p_{ij,k}\n\\end{equation}\n\\] We use this to amend our original likelihood to\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nA^{\\text{obs}}_{ij,k} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(q_{ij,k})\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nIn essence, this model assumes that\nAlthough false positives are also a possible source of bias, we leave this out of the model, for now.\nFinally, we need to declare hierarchical, non-centered priors for all parameters, beginning first with the interaction rates, then the detection probabilities, and finally the random effects. We assume a weakly informative \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) prior on all latent deviations, and \\(\\text{Exponential}(1)\\) for all SD."

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the degree distribution of the observed links is more zero-inflated and that the tail of the distribution has contracted. Altering the values of \\(\\sigma_u\\) and \\(\\sigma_v\\) can change these properties to some extent, especially the heaviness of the tail."
