I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Health and Environment Modeling Laboratory](https://healmod.osu.edu/). My research combines approaches from anthropology, ecology, and data science to understand the how humans, wildlife, and plants interact, and the complex patterns that emerge from these interactions.
